# Implementing a Distributed/Aggregated BloomFilter using Oracle Coherence
-Eliminate the need of using NamedCache.containsKey, instead store locally an snapshot BitMap representation of
what is stored on the storages nodes. 
Purpose: Exploring the idea of Continuos Aggregation and prevent a massive access from a Computing Grid

# Implementing Historic VAR simulation using Oracle Coherence (Typical Memory Bound Problem)
- Storing TimeSerie Data in Cassandra or an Oracle Database
- Massive TimeSerie Data Bulkloading
- Partial TimeSerie Data loading (Typical use case of On Demand TimeSerie Data loading or prevention of PartitionLost)
- Issue the request to load time serie data using The Processing Coherence Incubator Pattern
- In time series data such as this is to introduce a grouping of time periods into the cluster key (Key Association)
- Create a Portfolio using Bonds or Equities and run a Historic VAR Simulation with confidence interval of 99%, 500 days of TimeHorizon
- Implement Stresstesting, Backtesting

# Apache Spark and Oracle Coherence Integration
